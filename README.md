4.	Your objective is to learn a classifier whose prediction performance on testing data is high.
5.	You are expected to do model selection, model evaluation and tuning using cross validation.
6.	You are free to use any statistical learning model or combination of models.
7.	You are free to use any machine learning library.
8.	Prepare a presentation that should include your complete process how do you impute missing values, how do you handle imbalance dataset, model evaluation, inferences etcâ€¦
